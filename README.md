### Hi 👋!

<img width="30%" align="right" alt="Github" src="https://github.com/seasameye/seasameye/blob/main/%E7%8C%AB%E5%92%AA.png" />

I’m passionate about experiencing new things, learning cutting-edge knowledge, and enjoying life🐈. 
Here’s a bit about me🗒️:

- 🔭 I’m currently a CS student at Sichuan University.
- 📚 My research focuses on time series.
- 💛 I’m currently working on understanding machine learning, large language models (LLMs), backend development and big data.

Although I’m still improving my coding skills, I’m always striving to become a better learner and keep growing!
